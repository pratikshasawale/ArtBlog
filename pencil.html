                <p>Pencil drawing is an essential first step for many artists and designers, but it can also produce stunning art and designs.</p><p>Drawing techniques and tips for getting started - 
Get started with strong, simple contour drawings. Examine the outlines of objects. “Focus more on the shapes that your eyes are seeing instead of on how you think it should look,” says Reed. With foreshortening and perspective, our brains can play tricks on us, so push yourself to draw what you actually see.

 

Line drawings are especially useful for quick sketches and storyboarding, but a little shading can go a long way. Consider adding hatching or cross-hatching to your drawing and give value and tone to your designs with parallel and perpendicular lines. Another way to add shading to your sketches is blending. Sometimes blending digitally can be tricky, but you can learn to blur and blend shapes in Illustrator.</p>                

                <p>What a Beginner should sketch - Drawing with Pencil in Four Easy Steps
Apply the basics of this blog in all your drawing endeavors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a Reference Image-If you’re just getting started, a photograph is a great reference choice because it won’t move or change on you as you work. Go with something basic like a flower or simple object.</li>

<p><li>Make an outline-Draw the basic shape of your object, but don’t worry about realism here. It’s okay to take some liberties.</li></p>
<li>Add tones and texture-Once you’re happy with your basic sketch, you can start filling in and refining your drawing. Evaluate your reference image for distinct textures to convey in your drawing.</li>
<p><li>Refine your drawing-Finesse your drawing by using various pencil marks to shade and highlight certain areas. Using a variety of tones will suggest color even in a black-and-white piece. Start slow (you can always make an image darker, but making it lighter is more difficult) and pause every now and again to look at your image from a distance. It will help you determine what areas need more shading..</li></p></ul></div>
