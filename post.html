                <p>Painting on canvas has been a tradition in the arts since before the Renaissance. For hundreds of years, artists have been using canvas to make great pieces of art in oil and acrylic paints. If you have the right materials and prepare your canvas in the right way, you can paint the way the masters of the art world have for centuries.</p>
<p>Supplies You'll Need for Acrylic Painting - I've compiled a list of the things you'll need to get started with more detail further on:</p>                
<ul>
                  <li>Canvas Paint - Get the best quality paint you can afford.You don’t need many colors; a limited palette of basic colors is great for starters.</li>
                  <p><li>Brushes of Different Shapes and Sizes - A rule of thumb for brushes is to use big brushes for big areas and loose painting styles and to use small brushes for small areas and details. That's why it's important to have a variety of sizes.</li>
                  </p><li>Easel - It’s beneficial to keep your painting support at an angle directly opposite you as you work. This helps a lot with perspective and proportions. To keep your canvas or board inclined, you can use a stand-up easel or a tabletop one.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>What a Beginner should Paint - Even the best painters don't necessarily choose complicated subjects to paint. One of the most challenging things to paint for beginners is probably a portrait of a person. You don't have to start with a huge challenge.


Think about all of the beautiful paintings you've seen (or seen pictures of) that are of much simpler subjects.</p>

<ul>A vase of flowers
<li>A simple landscape.</li>
<li>A scene at the beach.</li>
<li>A still life of simple object.</li></ul></div>
